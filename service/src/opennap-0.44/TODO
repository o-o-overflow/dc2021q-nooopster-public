* add a timeout to check for blocked server connect() call

* desync between servers can happen if a +REGISTERED channel is created on a
  split server which contains no users on the other side of the split.
  currently the channel has to exist for the mode to be changed, so the
  +REGISTERED sent upon link will get dropped.  this is easy to fix as all
  you have to do is reset the REGISTERED bit on the server after it is
  relinked, but is there a better way to handle this case?

* fix memory leak with routing-only server

* throttle searches to lagging servers

* revise fast_snprintf()

* add MSG_SERVER_SYNC_END so that server's know when they are completely
  synced with each other, and can begin sending remote search requests

* still having cpu use problems with -DHAVE_POLL=1 !!!
